### Projects

Throughout my time at 3squared I worked on a number of different projects including:
* **RailSmart Docs, Forms, Hub**. A digital solution built in Vue.js, .NET and WebForms for the management of versioned documents, as well as the control and distribution of forms and form responses. I have helped fix many bugs across the whole application, as well as implement completely new features such as new pages, new components and even implementing Application Insights to gain better logging. I worked throughout the full stack.  
* **Forge UI Framework**. A reusable component library written in Vue.js that is shared across the different apps in the companies SaaS suite. I helped write new components and build a fifth version that supported tree-shaking. It was published to an Azure Artifacts registry. 
* **Forge CDN Explorer**. A Vue.js single page application that displays all the contents of our company CDN and allows users to browse the CDN and find images/assets they need for their application with live thumbnails and previews. They can then directly copy production URLs to various assets. I wrote this application as well as setup the full automated deployment to an Azure static web app.
